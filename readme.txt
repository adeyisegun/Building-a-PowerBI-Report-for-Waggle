Building a PowerBI Report for Waggle
The project involved creating a comprehensive Power BI report for Waggle, focusing on comparing the data from Lapcat (fitness collar for cats) with the findings obtained from Lapdog (fitness collar for dogs) devices. Waggle, an innovative company, was delighted with the success of their Lapdog device, which allows pet owners to monitor their dog's activity levels, receive alerts for walks, and repel fleas. The boardroom-ready Power BI report developed for this project effectively communicated the insights and story behind the data, highlighting the similarities and differences between the two devices. The project showcased proficiency in Power BI and data visualization, providing Waggle with valuable insights for product enhancement and decision-making.
